# DataCleaning-FIFA23Players
This repository features a Python project for cleaning and transforming the FIFA 23 players dataset using pandas. It focuses on handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and reshaping the data to prepare it for analysis.

This project answer the following questions:

- Do the height and weight columns have the appropriate data types?
- Can you seperate the joined column into year, month and day columns?
- Can you clean and transform the value, wage and release clause into columns of integer?
- How can you remove the newline characters from the Hits column?
- Should you seperate the Team & Contract column into separate Team and Contract columns?
